These scripts originally come from https://github.com/JeffersonLab/PRadSim/tree/master/evgen/newep
I modified the input and output style to make it easier for me to get the numbers
#newep is the origin directories
#newep_born is the born elastic cross section using Ventat2011 
#newep_rc is the xs after RC using Ventat2011
#sys is the directories using different models. 
To run it, first setup enviroment on duke machine env_PRad.sh. Then make. Then modify the run_newep.sh to run multiple lines.
